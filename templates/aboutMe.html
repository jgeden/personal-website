            <h1>😀 Hey, I'm Josh.</h1>
            <p>I am a student at Duke University where I am studying Computer Science, Linguistics, & German, and will be graduating May 2023. Go Blue Devils 🔵😈!</p>
            <p>At Duke, I am a member of the International Collegiate Programming Competition club (it's like Leetcode but on steroids). I am also a student researcher with Yang Lab 👨‍🔬. We focus on applications of machine learning and natural language processing to combat vaccine misinformation 🖥🧠.</p>
            <p>I have also been a teaching assistant for 3 semesters at Duke, twice for Data Stuctures & Algorithms and once for Discrete Math for Computer Science 👨‍🏫🍎. Some of my favorite projects we have done have been Huffman Encoding, Text Predication with Hidden Markov models, and RSA encryption.</p>
            <p>I am currently a software engineer intern at Berkeley National Lab 🌇🇺🇸🧪. I am developing frontend and backend software in Javascript and Python to extend JupyterLab ☕️🐍🪐. This helps researchers at the lab by making the supercomputers at Berkeley more accessible and user friendly through Jupyter.</p>
