                    <h1>😄 Hey, I'm Josh.</h1>
                    <p>I am an undergrad student at Duke University, where I am studying Computer Science, Linguistics, & German, and will be graduating in May 2023. Go Blue Devils 🔵😈! I was born and raised in Greenville, SC 🌙🌴 and I went to high school at the S.C. Governor's School for Science and Math.</p>
                    <p>At Duke, I am a member of the International Collegiate Programming Competition club (it's like Leetcode but on steroids). I am also a student researcher with Yang Lab 👨‍🔬. We focus on applications of machine learning and natural language processing to combat vaccine misinformation 🖥🧠. I also do volunteer software development through <a href="https://www.technifynow.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener_noreferrer">Technify</a>.</p>
                    <p>I have also been a teaching assistant for 3 semesters at Duke 👨‍🏫🍎, twice for Data Stuctures & Algorithms and once for Discrete Math for Computer Science. Some of my favorite projects we have done have been Percolation modeling with BFS & DFS 💧, Text Predication with Hidden Markov models 🤔💬, and RSA encryption with functional programming 🤫.</p>
                    <p>I am currently a software engineer intern at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab 🌇🇺🇸🧪, where I am developing software in Javascript and Python to extend JupyterLab ☕️🐍🪐. My work focuses on making the supercomputers at Berkeley more accessible and user friendly through Jupyter. Check out my projects page to see some of these extensions!</p>
                    <p>In my free time, I love to play strategy games like Civ VI and Total War (or any other game where you spend a long time staring at a map) 🗺🎮. I also love to play pickup basketball and swim 🏀🏊‍♂️, and I am always down to get some Mexican food with friends 🌮.</p>
